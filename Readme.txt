Steps to train and test the model
===================================================================

Training the model
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the files and keep the dataset and the code in the same folder.
2. Open the file Air_Pollution_Prediction_DAQFF.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
3. In the first cell change the path of the dataset to the path where the dataset is stored. And set the location where you want to store the trained model.
4. Run all the cells in the notebook.

Testing the model
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the files and keep the dataset and the code in the same folder.
2. Open the file testing.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
3. In the first cell change the path of the dataset to the path where the dataset is stored. In the second cell choose the step size the default training and testing is done on step size 14 so make sure before testing on sone other step size train on that specific step size.
4. Run all the cells in the notebook and take the MSE and MAE from the last cell's output.
